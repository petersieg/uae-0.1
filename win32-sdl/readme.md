Hi neozeed.

I just love to read about historic software and having them still be able to run within actual os. Many thanks for your blog and tinkering with such old gems.
I have put uae-0.1 on github and would like to also include your win32-sdl quick hack as well – if this is ok with you?

best regards, Peter

sure go ahead, it’s all “open/free” so do with it as you wish.

Glad you enjoy it all!
